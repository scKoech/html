the most high paying jobs in the world.</p>

<h1 style="font-style:italic">PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</h1>
<p>I have so far learned that there are many programming languanges each serving different functionalities:</p>
<p>1.Html is used for web development</p>
<p>2.CSS is for designing web pages</p>
<p>3.Javascript is for programming webpages</p>
<p>Many companies require websites to advertise their services others require an application</p>
<p>Other companies require both.</p>
<p>A developer is hired to do this and they use programming languages to do so.</p>
